            <p1>Prior to the 2019 fire, 70 percent of the facilities of Star City were covered and air-conditioned. The amusement park 
                introduced various types of rides and attractions in the Philippines. It hosted the double-deck carousel, 360-degree-loop 
                roller coaster (the Zyklon Loop), and water log ride (the Jungle Splash) in the country. It hosted Snow World, the largest 
                permanent ice entertainment area in the country, which featured ice carvings, a snow play area and the country's longest ice 
                slide. Another attraction in the amusement park was the inverted roller coaster Star Flyer, which opened in 2007 and was 
                marketed as the first inverted coaster in the Philippines.</p1>
            <br><br>
            <p2>Star City hosts the Giant Star Wheel Ferris wheel. It has 32 air-conditioned gondolas, each seating up to six persons. In 
                2012 it was said to be the tallest Ferris wheel in the Philippines. Conflicting reports credit it with a height 
                of 60 m (197 ft) and 62.5 m (205 ft) tall.</p2>
            <br><br>
            <p3>Within the amusement park complex are the Aliw and Star Theaters, with a combined seating capacity of 4,000.</p3>
            <br><br>
            <p4>The amusement park has 25 operating rides upon its reopening in February 2022.</p4>

        <div class="about">
            <h1 style="font-size: 30px;">History</h1>
            <p5>The park was established in 1991 as an offshoot of the annual Toys and Gift Fair, a Christmas trade exhibition by the 
                Philippine Center for International Trade and Exhibit (PhilCite), which was first organized in 1976. In the 1990s under 
                Fred Elizalde, the fair evolved into an amusement park later named Star City. The former PhilCite building upon which 
                the park was based upon was pulled down in the late 1990s to make way for the park's indoor rides.</p5>
            <br><br>
            <h2 style="font-size: 22px;">Destruction by fire</h2>
            <p6>Star City was hit by a major fire on October 2, 2019, which destroyed about 80 percent of the main Star City building, 
                which housed over 30 rides and attractions. At least 25 of those were damaged in the fire, including Gabi ng Lagim, 
                Dungeon of Terror, Bump Car Smash, and Snow World. The outdoor area, which includes the Star Flyer and Star Frisbee, 
                was mostly spared by the fire. Initial damage estimates ranged from 15 million to 1 billion Philippine pesos.</p7>
            <br><br>
            <h3 style="font-size: 22px;">Reopening</h3>
            <p8>In December 2021, Star City's social media accounts posted a teaser suggesting that the amusement park will be reopened.
                 The reopening was planned on January 14, 2022, however the opening has been postponed due to an increase of COVID-19 
                 cases in Metro Manila brought by the Omicron variant amidst a pandemic of the disease which reached the metropolis in 
                 early 2020. After some delays, the park reopened on February 24, 2022.</p8>
